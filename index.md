The first release of the addon for JIRA will target the following features
(grayscaled pictures are currently draft mockups as development guideline).

<br/>

### **Skill Management**

### Skill Catalog

> Which skills are needed in my organization or market? Where I can find materials and related readings?

![](/site/img/skill.catalog.filter.list.png)

<br/>
The skill catalog provides a simplified way to create, list and review all the
skills needed by projects and the whole organization. You can define labels and provide a 
description to every skill and you can link training materials, web resources and proficiency tests.
You can also quickly access to the list of people that have a specific skill. The user interface is
familiar and based on the standard JIRA filter view.

### Issues and Skills

> Which specific skill is needed to carry out my tasks and resolve issues?

<br/>
You can define the skills needed to accomplish issues or tasks directly from the "Create" or
"Edit" issue screen. The "Skills" field is automatically populated whole typing.
The issue-skill linkage enables employee resume autocreation, project/group/user statistics 
and further performance assessment automations.

### Skill Matrix

![](/site/img/skill.matrix.filter.list.png)

<br/>
The skill matrix provides a quick and effective way to review the current status of
projects, groups, users or whole organization in terms of skills and their proficiency
coverage, worked hours and enabled people. The list can also be filtered for recruitment 
applicants and/or external contractors. The user interface is familiar and based on the standard JIRA filter view.

### User Profile and Resume

> Where I can find my own updated resume and skill matrix?

![](/site/img/user.profile.with.resume.png)

<br/>
Every JIRA user (employee, candidate or contractor) can review, edit and export his/her 
own resume and skill matrix. The information are automatically retrieved by the system,
specifically from issue work logs, issue needed skills, project description and analytics.
The user can add custom skills, a bio and certifications. Through the skill catalog, the user
can mark skills that he/she would like to learn. The project leaders can mark skills to be
improved for team members.
