The main project goal is to extend Atlassian products with people
management enhancements and tools.  
The team will develop a set of open source addons for JIRA, Confluence, 
Crucible and Hipchat to simplify the HR activities and management for
enterprise and SMEs.

The features included within the overall roadmap are:

- skills and training management
- credentials and company profile
- performance reviews and celebration

- team and project climate analytics

The project will be carried out by the team mainly as a weekend project
